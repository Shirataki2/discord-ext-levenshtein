class Levenshtein:
    """The root of the module.

    Creates a list of commands when ``on_ready`` is called,
    and dispatches the ``on_command_suggest`` coroutine
    when command_not_found is invoked.

    Args:
        bot (:class:`~discord.ext.commands.Bot`):
            discord.py bot instance
        max_length (int):
            The Levenshtein distance threshold
            for considering a similar command.

            the Levenshtein distance is a string metric
            for measuring the difference between
            two sequences.
            
            Informally, the Levenshtein distance
            between two words is the minimum number
            of single-character edits
            (insertions, deletions or substitutions)
            required to change one word into the other.

    Note:
        When CommandNotFound exception is raised
        in discord.py, ``command_suggest`` event will be dispatched.

        The ``command_suggest`` event is given two arguments,
        the former is the Context(:obj:`~discord.ext.commands.Context`) and
        the latter is a list of similar commands
        (``List(str)``).
